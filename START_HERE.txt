Okay, here's how to run everything:

## **SIMPLEST WAY - Run the GUI**

```bash
cd /Users/gouthamarcot/Documents/Quantum/codebases/OmniQ
./run_omniq.sh
```

Or directly:

```bash
cd /Users/gouthamarcot/Documents/Quantum/codebases/OmniQ/omniq-debugger/build
./omniq-debugger
```

This launches the full Qt debugger with **ALL** the features we implemented:
- ✅ 3D visualizations (Bloch, Entanglement Graph, Hilbert Space)
- ✅ Circuit viewer with zoom/pan
- ✅ State analysis
- ✅ All quantum metrics

---

## Summary of What's Ready

**✅ Qt GUI (omniq-debugger):** Fully functional, all 3D features working
**✅ C++ Library (libomniq-core):** All 15 modules compiled and ready
**⚠️ Python Bindings:** Basic features work, new features need binding code

**For now, use the Qt GUI** - it has everything!

If you need Python bindings for the new features (Clifford, QEC, etc.), let me know and I'll add them (~30 min).
