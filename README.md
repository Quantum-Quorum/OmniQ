**OmniQ: Seamless Quantum Programming Across Python, Julia, and C.**

OmniQ is a modern, open-source software library designed for quantum computing research and development. Its primary goal is to provide a unified and intuitive interface for constructing, simulating, and executing quantum algorithms, accessible from Python, Julia, and potentially high-performance C applications via a robust core engine.

**Why OmniQ?**

* **Cross-Language Interoperability:** Write quantum code in Python or Julia using a consistent API, powered by a potentially high-performance C/C++ backend. Integrate quantum components into larger applications written in any of these languages.
* **Ease of Use:** Focus on an intuitive programming model for defining quantum circuits, gates, and measurements.
* **Flexibility:** Support for various quantum computational paradigms, including circuit-based computation, variational algorithms (QML), and potentially others.
* **Extensibility:** Designed to be modular, allowing easy addition of new gates, devices, and application modules.
* **Performance:** (Optional/Goal) Leverage a C-based core for efficient simulation and potentially optimized execution on quantum hardware.

## Key Features

* Unified API for Python and Julia.
* Core computational routines implemented in C for performance (Goal).
* Support for standard quantum gate sets and circuit construction.
* Interfaces to various quantum simulators (built-in, external) and hardware backends (e.g., IBM Quantum, IonQ via API).
* Dedicated modules for specific applications:
    * **Quantum Machine Learning (QML):** Variational circuits, quantum kernels, gradient computation, integration with classical ML frameworks.
    * **Quantum Cryptography:** Implementations and building blocks for algorithms like Shor's, Grover's, and QKD protocols.
* (Add other key features as they are developed)

Core Concepts
(Explain the main abstractions used in OmniQ, e.g.:)

Device: Represents the backend (simulator or QPU) where computations run. (oq.device(...))
QNode: A quantum function bound to a device. Transforms a classical function describing a circuit into an executable quantum computation. (@oq.qnode(...) / @qnode ... function ...)
Quantum Functions: Regular Python/Julia functions containing quantum operations.
Operations: Gates (oq.Hadamard, oq.CNOT, oq.RX, etc.) and measurement types (oq.expval, oq.probs, oq.state, etc.).
Wires: System for addressing qubits (e.g., integer indices).
Parameters: How gate parameters (e.g., rotation angles) are handled, especially for variational circuits.
